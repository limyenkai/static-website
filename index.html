            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I've been passionate and obsessed with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
                I'm a huge believer in letting machine do what they are best at doing, repetitive tasks and finding
                complicated patterns in a given data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being in pre-sales, I'm always happy to carry out a lot of research and development to meet customer's
                tech
                requirements. For instance, I have carried out a proof of concept of how I can make a GPT based chatbot
                tailored to a
                specific business by training it with specific knowledge, creating a chatbot that give users an
                intuitive experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also developed automation scripts that turns otherwise mundane and repetitive tasks into something
                that can be done
                with a click of a button. My focus is on creating efficient and scalable scripts that save time,
                increase accuracy, and
                reduce operational costs.
                As a continuous learner, I remain open to new products, skills, and perspectives that challenge myself
                to improve and
                refine my expertise. I also enjoy engaging with new people to exchange ideas and learn more about
                different industries,
                from technology to finance and fintech.
